I am intersted in Environmental Health and Occupational Health sciences. 
I currently work at [Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory](https://lamont.columbia.edu/).
As a lab manager of the [Trace Organic lab (TraceOrg)](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/research/centers/niehs-center-environmental-health-northern-manhattan/facility-cores/translational-research-support-core), I work on developing analytical methods to measure organic pollutants and biomarkers (e.g., pesticides, PAHs, BPA, parabens) and to quantify micro- and nanoplastics in environmental and biological samples.
