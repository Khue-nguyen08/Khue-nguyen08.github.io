```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
library(p8105.datasets)
```

Let's load the dataset
```{r}
data("nyc_airbnb")
nyc_airbnb =
  nyc_airbnb |>
  mutate (
    rating = review_scores_location/2
  )|>
  select(
    neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, rating, price,
    room_type, lat, long
  )|>
  filter(neighbourhood_group == "Manhattan",
room_type == "Entire home/apt",
price <= 500,
price >= 100)
```
Let's make scatterplot

```{r}
nyc_airbnb |>
  mutate(
    label = str_c("Price: $", price, "Rating: ", rating)
  )|>
  plot_ly(
    x = ~lat, y = ~ long, color = ~price,
    type = "scatter", mode = "markers", alpha = 0.5
  )
```

let's mmake a boxplot
```{r}

nyc_airbnb |>
  mutate(
    neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood, price)
  )|>
  plot_ly(
    x = ~neighbourhood,
    y = ~ price,
    color = ~ neighbourhood, colors = "viridis",
    type = "box"
  )
```
